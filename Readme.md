## How it Works

ShellShare establishes a robust tunnel between an SSH server and an HTTP server using Golang channels, facilitating seamless file streaming and sharing.

#### Core Functionality:
1. **Tunnel Establishment**:Creates a tunnel between SSH and HTTP servers leveraging Golang channels.
2. **SSH Session & File Streaming**:Initiates an SSH session for efficient file streaming and sharing.
3. **Shareable Link Generation**:Upon receiving a signal in the SSH server, generates a shareable link.
4. **Data Propagation**: Pushes signal data through Golang channels.
5. **Download Link Activation**:Upon user interaction (clicking the download link), the server listens to the designated channel.
6. **File Wrapping & HTTP Response**:Starts encapsulating file bytes into the HTTP response for download.
